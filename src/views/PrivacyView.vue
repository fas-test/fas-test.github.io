    </p>
    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to Future Assessment Service. We are committed to respecting your privacy and protecting your personal data.
      This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your personal information. We also describe your choices
      regarding the use, access, and correction of your personal information.<br>
      By using our services, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.
    </p>
    <p><i>Core service</i></p>
    <p>
      The primary business activity of Future Assessment Service is to provide educational and psychological testing services,
      including test development, test administration, scoring, and reporting. We also engage in research to continually improve
      the validity, reliability, and fairness of our tests, and offer consultancy services for educational institutions to best
      utilize assessment data for educational improvement and planning. The collection and processing of personal and academic
      data are integral to this core service, enabling us to offer accurate and reliable educational assessments for students,
      schools, and parents.
    </p>
    <p><i>Scope</i></p>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy applies to all services offered by Future Assessment Service and any of its affiliates.
    </p>
    <p><i>Compliance</i></p>
    <p>
      We operate in accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as well as other relevant data protection
      and privacy laws specific for a said territory.
    </p>
    <p><i>Children under 16</i></p>
    <p>
      For users under the age of 16, the educational tests are typically ordered by schools or educational institutions.
      In these instances, the school is responsible for obtaining informed consent from parents or guardians for the collection
      and processing of the child's personal data. Alternatively, if parents or guardians are directly ordering the testing
      services for their children, the act of ordering constitutes informed consent for the collection and processing of
      the child's personal data in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
